Just wrapped up a small but practical automation challenge in Python!

I built a Folder Synchronization Script that keeps two directories in sync (source â†’ replica), copying new/updated files and logging changes along the way.

The best part? It only uses Pythonâ€™s standard library (os, shutil, filecmp, argparse, logging) â€” no external dependencies needed.

This project gave me hands-on experience with:
âœ… Command-line interfaces with argparse
âœ… Logging for real-world debugging
âœ… File system operations in Python

A small step, but an important one as I continue growing in Python, ML, and Data Science. ðŸ’»
